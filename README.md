# KNN_Implementation

## What is KNN Algorithm

## K-Nearest Neighbors is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression.
## It predicts the label of a data point based on the majority class (or average value) of its K nearest neighbors in the feature space.

## How KNN Works:

## 1.Choose the number of neighbors K.
## 2.Measure the distance (e.g., Euclidean) between the new data point and all others in the dataset.
## 3.Find the K points closest to the new point.
## 4.For: 
## 1.Classification: Assign the majority class among K neighbors.
## 2.Regression: Take the average of their values.
